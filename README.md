To create a table on the CityScope
-Opt 1: On its editor, https://cityscope.media.mit.edu/CS_cityscopeJS/#/editor (if you delete a type after you download without ‘recreate’ a new grid, it will crash)
-Opt 2: The script Grid/edit_types.py generates the yable automatically with the types defined on lomas_types.json

Clone the repository and paste in terminal: $ pip install `-r requirements.txt` to install the requirements needed to run it locally
