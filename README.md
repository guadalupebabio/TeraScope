## New table on  CityScope
- Opt 1: On its editor, https://cityscope.media.mit.edu/CS_cityscopeJS/#/editor (if you delete a type after you download without ‘recreate’ a new grid, it will crash)
- Opt 2: The script Grid/edit_types.py generates the yable automatically with the types defined on lomas_types.json

## Run it locally
- Clone the repository
- Make sure you have pip installed
- paste in terminal: $ pip install `-r requirements.txt`, this installs the requirements needed.
