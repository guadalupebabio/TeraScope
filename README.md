To create a table on the CityScope editor: https://cityscope.media.mit.edu/CS_cityscopeJS/#/editor
if you delete a type after you download without ‘recreate’ a new grid, it will crash. 
Working on a script to generate the grid automatically (grid_lomas_generator) so the types can be edited easyly (lomas_types.json)
